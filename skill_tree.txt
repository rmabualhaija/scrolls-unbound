NO RP OR CRAFTING NODES, JUST SEPERATE SYSTEMS FFS. 


Skill Nodes have direct ties to giving HP. 

Archetypes are designated via the use of resources specific nodes give. Adrenaline for Warriors, Mana for Wizards, Stamina for Rogues. In between these archetypes are sub archetypes that use the different resources simultaneously. 


Skill Nodes are placed in requisite “tiers” that determine differing cost based on the purchase of other “tiers.”


When you gain HP from one ability in the primary trees and you already have tiers in other tiers, refer to the chart below


When Tier is mentioned, use equivalent Tier HP amounts. 


Red Tier 1: 3HP, Red Tier 2: 6HP, Red Tier 3: 9 HP, Red Tier 4: 12HP, Red Tier 5: 15HP


Green Tier 1: 2HP, Green Tier 2: 4HP, Green Tier 3: 6HP, Green Tier 4: 8HP, Green Tier 5: 10HP


Blue Tier 1: 1HP, Blue Tier 2: 2HP, Blue Tier 3: 3HP, Blue Tier 4: 4HP, Blue Tier 5: 5HP


Purchasing RED but you have tiers in BLUE and/or GREEN:
RED TIER HP - (BLUE TIER HP + GREEN TIER HP)


Purchasing BLUE but you have tiers in RED and/or GREEN
BLUE TIER HP - (RED TIER HP + GREEN TIER HP)


Purchasing GREEN but you have tiers in RED and/or BLUE
GREEN TIER HP - (RED TIER HP + BLUE TIER HP) 


You can gain a minimum of 1 HP from these purchases. 


The Mystical Branch & Spellcasting
Spellcasting: Similar to Dungeons & Dragons 5th Edition, this system relies on you using a mental ability to cast your spells, such as intelligence, wisdom or charisma.  However, unlike D&D 5e, the ability that one uses to cast spells may change quite often.  Whenever you spend LP on a mystical node for the first time, you must decide which ability score will be used for your “spellcasting ability”.  You may choose from either intelligence, wisdom or charisma.  
Learning Spells: Every spell you learn, after purchasing one from the “+1 spell” node, is always considered to be prepared.  There is no “preparing spells” when using this skill tree.


When you read about purchasing spells from the “Spell” node’s description, you will notice that certain spells are unavailable to purchase unless you have the required amount of mana in your mana pool.  This means that you cannot purchase a 2nd level spell, for example, until you have a maximum amount of mana in your mana pool equal to or more than 10.


In order to have a maximum mana pool of 10, you would have needed to purchase from the “Mana” node 5 times, gaining 2 mana from each purchase.

Spending Mana: The cost to make a spell slot using mana is not a 1:1 ratio.  Instead you spend the corresponding amount of mana listed on the table below.  


When you spend mana, think of it like a “mana bar” in video games.  Mana is not gone forever when spent.  When you take a long rest, you regain all of your spent mana, bringing your mana pool back up to full.  Alternatively, you can also spend hit dice during a short rest, to recover any spent mana. 


Casting High Level Spells: You may only cast one 7th, 8th and 9th level spell per day.  If you choose to cast an additional 7th, 8th or 9th level spell in a day you must make a constitution saving throw where the DC is equal to 10 + the spells level.  On a successful roll, the spell is cast.

As an action, by spending 2 mana you can transform into any creature listed in your “shape changes” list.  You can change these shapes during a Long Rest. This transformation lasts for 10 minutes, unless otherwise stated.
While you are transformed, the following rules apply:
   * Your game statistics are replaced by the statistics of the creature you changed into, but you retain your personality, and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores. You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature. If the creature has the same proficiency as you and the bonus in its stat block is higher than yours, use the creature's bonus instead of yours. If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.
   * When you transform, you assume the creature's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form, For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.

   * 3rd purchase: You can spend 2 mana to cast counterspell, at 1st level.  However, you are unable to use this ability if the mana used for that spell exceeds your mana pool maximum.
   * 4th purchase: Any time you counter a spell successfully, you regain mana equal to the amount of mana used to cast that spell.  Additionally, you can add that countered spell to the list of spells you know. 
   * 5th purchase:  If ever you regain mana from a spellbroken ability, and you are not missing any mana, or the amount of mana gained would bring you to a total higher than your maximum mana score, you change into a “Spellbroken Form”.  You may choose to transform into either a beast, crystal or soul form.  When this happens, your spellcasting ability score becomes 5 and you can no longer concentrate on spells while in this form.  However, you can still cast spells.  Your Spellbroken form lasts for 1 minute, and when it ends you gain 1 level of exhaustion, and the amount of mana you have left in your mana pool is halved. You cannot switch between forms and must commit to each one


Beast Form
Your body begins to swell under the ever building pressure of magical force that whirlpools inside of you. Every fibre of muscle in your body fills with arcane energy causing your body to grow to twice its size. This magical energy can also cause a whole series of strange mutations from sprouting horns, scales or claws to your hair growing out or falling out entirely. As your mind becomes clouded your body becomes that of a beast. 


Whenever you transform into your beast form, increase your strength score by 5 (to a maximum of 25). 
Additionally, while in this form you get advantage on all Strength based saving throws and ability checks. You also take half damage from all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage. You also count as one size larger and can carry twice your carrying capacity. Lastly, whenever you make an melee attack as an action, you can make 1 additional melee attack, and your unarmed attacks deal 1d8 slashing bludgeoning or piercing damage (your choice).


Crystal Form
Unable to contain the arcane energy within you it bursts from your body and begins to crystallise, turning your flesh, bone and mind into solid crystal. The transmutation of the body to gemstone leaves you in a sorry state when the transformation eventually ends. However, during this transformation you have never felt so invincible. However even after returning to your original form your body still left partly changed. Fragments of crystal still remain
inside and out of your flesh and bone leaving you with small remnants of the power you once possessed.


Whenever you transform into your crystal form, increase your AC by 5.  
Additionally, while in this form you get advantage on all Constitution based saving throws and ability checks. You also take half damage from all non-magical piercing, and slashing damage. You also gain a vulnerability to thunder damage but become resistant to psychic damage.
From now on, whenever you are not in your spellbroken form, your natural AC increases by 1.


Soul Form
The magical force within you begins to fuse with your very soul and begins to shed your physical body like an unwanted chrysalis. While in this spiritual form made of pure arcane energy, the very air around you begins to swirl, with you at its centre. You now exist in three places at once; the material plane, the ethereal realm and within the very weave of magic itself. Upon returning to your original form, the arcane energy around you tries to piece back together and regenerate the body that once was, leaving you born anew after every transformation.


Whenever you transform into your soul form, increase your Dexterity score by 5 (to a maximum
of 25).  
Additionally, while in this form you get advantage on all Dexterity based saving throws and ability checks. You weigh no more than a single pound.  You also take half damage from all non-magical bludgeoning, piercing, and slashing damage.  


During your turn, while in your soul form, you can use your movement action to teleport to any space you can see, up to your speed. When you do this you enter into, and move through, the ethereal plane before reappearing in the space you chose to “teleport” to. To anyone without the ability to see into the ethereal plane, it looks like you teleported.
